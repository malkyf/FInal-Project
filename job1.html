    <h1 > Kathryn Kosey</h1>
    <p> Kathryn Kosey has been working at HealthSpace Data Systems for 5 years
        and has been a web-based software developer for over 13 years. She
        started off in a single area of the company and now is in a team of
        Principal Engineers. Her team is not given a specific project but
        instead helps and supports other teams with their work. She has worked
        in system architecture, server and devops administration, data
        migrations and transformation, and some client project management. </p>
    <p> Kathryn Kosey would advise somebody looking into this field to always be
        very curious and look for more ways to learn. You should try to see what
        areas of coding you really enjoy and strengthen them. She also says that
        when choosing a job, you should think about whether you would prefer a
        bigger company or a smaller company. In a bigger company you can learn
        from so many different people who have been coding for much longer yet
        in a smaller company you get to try so many new things and expand your
        knowledge and horizons. In addition, Kathryn says that hands on
        experience is super important and useful but a CS degree is also very
        helpful, (especially in very complex problems, AI and machine learning).
        She herself got her Bachelor’s in Fine Arts and a major in Digital arts
        with a minor in Computer Science. She says that it can be challenging
        during interviews but once you have experience you shouldn’t have to
        worry. </p>
    <p> Something really interesting that Kathryn Kosey said is that it's really
        important to know how to google search. Some people know exactly what to
        type into the search bar and their results will appear and she said this
        is super important. She also said that it is important to be curious and
        want to learn new things. You don’t need to be creating something brand
        new all the time; sometimes you can create something that already exists
        just to see how it is done. </p>
    <p> As Kathryn has always worked from home, Covid-19 did not change her day
        to day life. She has a meeting over video conference at the beginning of
        the week. There, everybody discusses what the plan is for the week and
        any current problems they are facing with their projects. After this
        meeting, she is usually working in team support,  in other meetings about
        product and team strategy, or working on her current projects. She
        normally works around 40 hours a week yet she says that sometimes she
        has worked 50 or even 55 hours a week if she needed to. She says that
        some people work 40 hours and others work more, it just depends on the
        person and if they have any upcoming deadlines.</p>
