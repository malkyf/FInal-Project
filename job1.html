    <h1 > Kathryn Kosey</h1>
    <p> Kathryn Kosey is a web based software developer. She has been doing this for the past 13 years.
        For the past 5 years she has been working as a Junior Software Developer at HealthSpace Data Systems.
         This is a cloud-based software mostly for health systems used as a service for government offices
         in the US and Canada. They work with people ranging from state governments to cities. During her time
         at HealthSpace Data Systems, she jumped from a full-stack developer to working with all sorts of
         things like system architecture, server and DevOps administration, data migration and
         transformation and client project management. She hops a lot from different teams helping them out
         and is currently working on DevOps, database optimization, streamlining of internal processes and
         workflows. Something cool about her job is that she has always worked remotely even before the pandemic.
         Another interesting fact is that she got her Bachelor’s degree in Fine arts with a major in Digital Arts
         and a minor in Computer Science. She says that although this made interviews slightly difficult, she
         gained a lot from her hands on experience and it didn’t make the biggest difference but she would
         recommend a computer science degree. She says a CS degree can be especially helpful with complex math
         problems, AI and machine learning. According to Kathryn Kosey, one of the most important qualities to
         have when interested in computer science, is to be curious and be aware that your job can be very different
         depending on the size of the company you work with. In a smaller company there is more opportunity to do
         many different jobs compared to a big company where everything is more structured and you do exactly
         what they tell you yet there are also many people you can learn from.
