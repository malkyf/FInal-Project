    <h1> Avigail Michalowitz  </h1>
        <p> Avigail Fohrman has been working in computer science for the past 4 years.
            She interned at google during college and now works there on the material
            design team. She says that her schedule is pretty flexible. She usually
            works for around 40 hours a week. Before she was married she worked for
            more and now that she has a family sometimes a little bit left. She says
            that when she gets to work she usually gets some work in before grabbing
            a coffee and breakfast and then works till lunch. During lunch sometimes
            there are events and cool speakers or meetings with her team or other
            teams they are working with. There is also a get together with all the
            religious women every Rosh Chodesh. Avigail says that computer science is
            like a “Team sport” and you have to work and communicate with everybody on your
            team to get things done efficiently. After lunch, she usually either gets more work
            done or is in more meetings. She says that she thinks this field is going to have a
            lot of remote work opportunities after the pandemic is over.
        </p>
        <p> 	Avigail would tell anybody interested in this field to just “go for it”.
            She says that you should just start experimenting and building things. This is
            also going to be really great for your application to any job. She says that
            the most important skill to have when considering computer science is a
            willingness to learn new things and by having this, you will learn new things
            that are important. In addition, she advises people to get a computer science
            degree. Even though nowadays people are getting accepted into Google without
            one, according to her it is still very important and useful. Getting as much
            experience as mentioned above with experimental projects and things like that
            is also really important.
