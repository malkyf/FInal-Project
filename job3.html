    <h1> Joey Marianer </h1>
        <p> Joey Marianer is a Senior Software Developer who works in algorithm development. He says that many
            people focus on the specific languages and frameworks but in reality, once you understand how to
            code, you can code using any language and that becomes the easiest part of coding. For somebody
            interested in this field he says that it really helps to work with practice problems to exercise
            your brain and help you think the right way. The most important skill that is necessary for this
            job according to Joey is a knack for puzzles. A lot of computer science is figuring things out and
            putting things together so a love for puzzles is very important when going into this field. He also
            says that it is much more important and helpful to have hands-on experience than a computer science
            degree. A computer science degree is very helpful when finding jobs but he says it might be worth it
            to work at not such a great job when first starting and get more experience.  He himself got a
            degree from not an amazing college but started working during highschool.

            Joey Marianer has always been working from home so the pandemic did not really change his day to day
            life. He has projects to work on and can do it whenever. Generally his hours are very flexible. He
            has to check with his manager or team every day either through a meeting or email. Once a week he
            has a meeting day where him and his team get together and discuss what the plan is for the week.
            His manager also meets with each team member individually to talk about how they are doing. In
            addition, he says that most of his work is individual but becomes “friendly” friends with the
            people he works with. He also says that the hours in a computer science job vary on how much time
            you want to put into it. If you love your work or if you have a difficult project and want to work
            a lot you can, but if you want to spend more time with your family or other things, you can work
            less hours as long as you complete the work.

            According to Joey Marianer, this field is not going to change so much in the next 5-10 years. He
            says that if you look at the past 10 years, coding has been more or less the same. People find a
            problem or need and find a solution to it by programming the computer. He says that it will
            probably remain the same way. There will probably be new technologies and many advancements but
            it will still be the same idea.
